# Advent of Code 2024

This is my solutions repo for [Advent of Code 2024][aoc].

## File Structure

Structure is simple enough: I go into `src/dayXX` and write my solutions there.

I'll write a Makefile to run each day's program, so that I can write different
programs in different languages.

## Licensing

This project is free and open source software, licensed under the MIT license.
You are free to study, use, modify, and redistribute this software.

As these are toy programs at best (and not full software I intend to
distribute), I chose MIT instead of my preferred GPL to be more permissive.

See `LICENSE` for the full text. Also, take a look at [Github's Choose a License
page][license] for a nice, short explanation.
